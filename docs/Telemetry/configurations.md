### configurations for connecting with  opentelemetry collector and elastic search.

```yaml
# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
# ... (all the commented out default settings can remain commented) ...
 
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
cluster.name: my-local-dev-cluster # Give it a simple name
 
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
node.name: node-1 # Simple node name
 
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
# It's good practice to define these, even if using defaults,
# especially if you run multiple ES instances later.
# Default paths are usually within the ES installation directory.
# path.data: data
# path.logs: logs
 
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
# Bind to localhost only for local development for better security
network.host: 127.0.0.1
http.port: 9200
 
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
# Critical for a single-node development setup
discovery.type: single-node
 
# --- VITAL: Disable Security for Local Development ---
# --- Delete or comment out the entire auto-generated security block ---
# --- and add these lines instead: ---
 
xpack.security.enabled: false
xpack.security.enrollment.enabled: false # Not relevant if security is off
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: false   # Disable SSL for HTTP
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: false # Disable SSL for inter-node communication
 
# --- END VITAL SECURITY MODIFICATION ---
 
# You can leave the rest of the file as is (mostly commented out defaults).
# The auto-generated cluster.initial_master_nodes is not needed if discovery.type=single-node
# and security is off.
# The http.host: 0.0.0.0 can be changed to 127.0.0.1 for better local security.

## Starting the OpenTelemetry Collector

To start the OpenTelemetry Collector, follow these steps:

**1. Navigate to the OpenTelemetry Collector directory:**
```python
cd <path_to_otel_collector_directory>
```
**2. Run the Collector with your configuration file:**
```python
<otel_collector_executable> --config "<path_to_config_file>"
#example
otelcol-contrib.exe --config "C:\Users\user\Downloads\config.yaml"
```

## Starting Elasticsearch and Loading Modules

**1. Navigate to the bin Folder:**

  Open your command prompt or terminal and go to the Elasticsearch installation directory. Then, proceed to the bin folder.

**2. Run the Batch File:**

  Inside the bin folder, execute the appropriate batch file. This will start Elasticsearch and automatically load all necessary modules.
