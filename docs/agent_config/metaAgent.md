**Meta Agent** Serves as the central decision making entity. Individual agents are coordinated by a central **supervisor** agent. The supervisor controls all communication flow and task delegation, making decisions about which agent to invoke based on the current context and task requirements.

### **Meta Agent Onboarding**

The following are the steps for onboarding the Meta agent with an example:

1. **Select Template**: Select agent template.

    * `Agent Template`  META AGENT
![Meta Agents Template](../images/meta_agent_type.png)

2. **Select Agents**: from the listed Agents - select the `React` or `Multi` Agent/s using which we want to create the meta agent.

    * `Agents`   Movie Recommendation Agent, Research_Scholar_Agent
![List of Agents](../images/add_agents.png)

3. **Agent Name**:  Provide a suitable agent name. 

    * `Agent Name`  Movie_and_scholar_Agent

4. **Agent Goal**:  Provide goal of the agent - objective of the agent.

The workflow is designed to provide tailored, context-aware content, enhancing both leisure exploration and research discovery through a unified, tool driven pipeline.

5. **Workflow description**: Provide detailed instructions to the LLM - Guidelines to the agent. 

     * `Sample Workflow description`:

        > User Input and Intent Classification:
        >
        > The user initiates the interaction by entering a query, such as:
        >
        > - “Top action movies about war”
        > - “Explore the intersection of AI and climate modeling”
        >
        > The system classifies the query into one of two categories:
        > 
        > - **Entertainment Query (Movie-Related)**
        > - **Academic/Research Topic**
        > 
        >  **Movie Recommendation Path**:
        >
        > **Step 1: Movie Query Collection**  
        > Prompt the user to provide a movie-related query, e.g., “Top 10 adventure movies of all time.”

        > **Step 2: Wikipedia Search**  
        > Search Wikipedia for the query and retrieve the first relevant list-type article.

        > **Step 3: Extract Movie Links**  
        > Extract individual movie article URLs from the retrieved Wikipedia page.

        > **Step 4: Scrape Movie Metadata**  
        > Scrape metadata (e.g., title, genre, synopsis, director, release year, ratings) from the movie URLs.

        > **Step 5: Generate Recommendations**  
        > Use the scraped metadata to generate personalized movie recommendations with summaries and rationale.

        >  **Academic Research Path**:
        >
        > **Step 1: Research Topic Collection**  
        > Prompt the user to input a research topic, e.g., “Recent developments in quantum cryptography.”

        > **Step 2: Literature Search**  
        > Search Semantic Scholar for recent academic papers based on the query, retrieving details like title, abstract,      > authors, and DOI.

        > **Step 3: Publication Analysis**  
        > Analyze the retrieved papers to extract structured insights, including main findings, methodologies, and research gaps.

        > **Step 4 (Conditional): Cross-Disciplinary Synthesis**  
        > If the query spans multiple disciplines (e.g., “AI” + “Healthcare”), generate a synthesis report highlighting shared > challenges, innovation opportunities, and complementary methods.

        > **Step 5: Academic Report Generation**  
        > Compile findings into a formal academic report with sections like Title, Abstract, Literature Review, and Conclusion.

#### Goal to Achieve for the Workflow  
The **Movie_and_scholar_Agent** is designed to intelligently process user queries by dynamically identifying their intent—whether for entertainment (movie-related) or academic research—and delivering tailored, high-quality outputs. The Meta Agent must:  
1. **Classify User Intent**: Accurately determine whether the query is entertainment-focused or research-oriented.  
2. **Leverage Worker Agents**: Efficiently delegate tasks to the appropriate worker agents (Movie Recommendation Agent or Research_Scholar_Agent) based on the classified intent.  
3. **Ensure Workflow Completion**: Oversee the end-to-end execution of the workflow, ensuring the user receives personalized movie recommendations or structured academic insights.  
4. **Maintain Context Awareness**: Adapt responses to the user’s specific query, ensuring relevance, accuracy, and clarity in the final output.
