Hybrid agent onboarding follows a similar process to planner executor critic agent onboarding. For detailed steps, refer to the [planner executor critic agent onboarding](multiAgent.md) guide.

However, unlike planner executor critic agent onboarding where multiple system prompts are generated for each agent, the hybrid agent onboarding process generates a single system prompt that governs the behavior of the entire hybrid agent. This simplifies configuration and ensures unified agent responses.
