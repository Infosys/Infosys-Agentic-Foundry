# React Critic Agent Inference

The React Critic Agent inference setup provides a chat interface similar to the React Agent, allowing you to interact with the onboarded agent and observe the steps it takes to answer your queries. In addition, it displays critic scores for each step, offering deeper insight into the agent's reasoning and evaluation process.


## Steps Taken by the Agent
- You can view the steps taken by the agent to answer your query by clicking the "Execution steps" dropdown.
- For each step, the React Critic Agent displays the critic's evaluation and score, providing transparency into both the decision-making and quality assessment process.

## Retrieving Old Chats
- Retrieve your old chats by selecting them from the "Chat history" dropdown.
- This feature allows you to revisit previous conversations with the agent for reference or analysis.
- For more details, see [React Agent Retrieving Old Chats](./reactAgent_inference.md#retrieving-old-chats).
