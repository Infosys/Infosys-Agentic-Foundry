# Meta Agent Inference

The Meta Agent inference setup provides a comprehensive chat interface where you can interact with onboarded agents and observe their decision-making processes in real-time. This system allows you to test and evaluate agent performance while gaining insights into their reasoning steps.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Meta Agent inference system:

1. **Select Configuration**: Choose your Meta Agent template from the available options
2. **Choose Model**: Select the appropriate AI model for your use case
3. **Pick Agent**: Select the specific agent you want to interact with from your onboarded agents
4. **Start Chatting**: Begin your conversation with the selected agent

The interface provides a clean, intuitive chat experience similar to popular messaging applications, making it easy to communicate with your AI agents.

## Understanding Agent Responses

When you submit a query to the Meta Agent, it processes your request through multiple layers:

- **Query Analysis**: The agent first analyzes your question to understand the context and requirements
- **Agent Selection**: Based on the query type, the Meta Agent determines which specialized sub-agents to invoke
- **Collaborative Processing**: Multiple agents may work together to provide comprehensive answers
- **Response Synthesis**: The Meta Agent combines insights from various sources to deliver a coherent response

## Viewing Agent Steps

The system provides complete transparency into the agent's decision-making process:

- **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: Access detailed information about each step the agent takes
- **Agent Routing**: See which specific sub-agents were called and why
- **Decision Logic**: Understand the reasoning behind agent selections
- **Processing Timeline**: View the sequence of operations performed

This transparency feature is crucial for debugging, optimization, and building trust in the agent's capabilities.

## Chat History Management

The platform includes robust chat history functionality:

- **Session Persistence**: All conversations are automatically saved
- **Easy Retrieval**: Access previous conversations through the "Old Chats" dropdown
- **Search Capability**: Quickly find specific conversations or topics
- **Reference Material**: Use past chats for analysis, training, or documentation purposes

This feature enables continuous learning and improvement of your interaction patterns with the agents.
