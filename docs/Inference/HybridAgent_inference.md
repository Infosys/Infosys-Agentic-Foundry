# Hybrid Agent Inference

Hybrid agent inference works similarly to Multi Agent Inference. To use hybrid agent inference, you need to enable the `Plan Verifier` toggle. When you submit a query, the agent generates a plan. If you approve the plan, the agent executes it and provides the response.

The key difference is that, in multi agent inference, separate agents are responsible for generating the plan and executing it. In hybrid agent inference, a single agent handles both planning and execution.

For more details on multi agent inference, refer to the [Multi Agent Inference documentation](../Inference/multiAgent_inference.md).
