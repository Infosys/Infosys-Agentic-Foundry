# Planner Executor Agent Inference

The Planner Executor Agent Inference setup provides a chat interface where you can interact with the onboarded agent and observe the planning and execution steps for your queries. This agent type does not include a critic agent or critic scores, focusing instead on plan verification and user approval.

## Plan Verifier Option

You can enable the **Plan Verifier** option to review the plan generated by the agent for your query before execution.

## Viewing the Plan

When the Plan Verifier is enabled, the agent will display a detailed plan outlining the steps it will take to answer your query.

## Approving the Plan and Generating a Response


After reviewing the plan, you have two options:

- **Request a Revised Plan:**Tthe thumbs-down (dislike) icon if you are not satisfied with the plan. The agent will generate a revised plan based on your feedback, allowing you to review and approve the new plan before execution.

- **Approve the Plan:** The thumbs-up (like) icon for approving the plan. The agent will then execute the plan and generate a response to your query.
