## How Agentic AI Differs from Traditional Software and GenAI

**Traditional Systems:**

Traditional softwares including process automation, supervised machine learning (ML), and even generative AI lacks true autonomy. These systems perform only the tasks they are explicitly programmed or trained to do. They follow predefined instructions or generate outputs within defined parameters.

**What Makes Agentic AI Different:**

Agentic AI is designed to operate with autonomy. Rather than executing predefined tasks, it receives high-level goals or events as input and independently determines how to act in order to achieve the desired outcomes.

**Core Mechanisms of Agentic AI:**

Agentic AI integrates key capabilities to enable autonomous behavior:

- **Plan:** Develops a strategy to achieve the given goal or respond to an event.
- **Act:** Executes tasks and may interact with external systems or tools to carry out its strategy.
- **Reflect:** Evaluates the outcomes of its actions, learns from them, and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
- **Respond:** Delivers a final decision or result based on its planning and learning process.

**Key Characteristics:**

The output of an Agentic AI system is:

- **Goal-directed**  
- **Interactive**  
- **Context-aware**
