# Tool Interrupt

The Tool Interrupt feature provides users with enhanced control over how tools are executed within the framework. This feature allows users to review, modify, and approve tool executions before they are processed, giving greater transparency and control over the agent's behavior.

## Overview

Tool Interrupt is a toggle feature available in the inference section of the framework that changes how tools are called and executed when processing user queries.

**Toggle Location** :

The Tool Interrupt toggle button can be found in the **Inference** section of the framework interface.

## Operating Modes

### Without Tool Interrupt (Default Mode)

When Tool Interrupt is **disabled**, the system operates in automatic mode:

- User submits a query
- The agent automatically identifies required tools
- Tools are called sequentially with parameters derived from the user query
- Final answer is provided directly without user intervention

**Example:**
- User Query: `2-10*5`
- System Response: `The answer is -48`

### With Tool Interrupt (Interactive Mode)

When Tool Interrupt is **enabled**, the system operates in interactive mode :

- User submits a query
- System displays the first tool to be called with its parameters
- User can review and modify parameters before execution
- User approves each tool execution step-by-step
- System shows dependent tools in sequence
- Final answer is provided after all approvals

## Tool Interrupt Workflow

**Step 1: Tool Identification**

When a user submits a query, the system identifies the first tool that needs to be called and displays:

- **Tool Name**: The specific tool to be executed
- **Parameters**: The arguments that will be passed to the tool

**Step 2: Parameter Review and Editing**
Users have two options:

**Option A: Edit Parameters**

- Click the **"Edit"** button
- Modify the tool arguments as needed
- Confirm changes

**Option B: Approve Parameters**

- Click the **"üëç"** (thumbs up) button to approve current parameters
- System proceeds with the tool execution

**Step 3: Sequential Tool Execution**

- After approval, the tool executes with the specified parameters
- If additional tools are required, the system displays the next tool in the sequence
- Process repeats until all dependent tools are executed

**Step 4: Final Result**

- Once all tools have been executed, the system provides the final answer

**Practical Example**: Calculator Agent

Let's walk through a detailed example using a Calculator Agent with the following tools:

- `add(a, b)` - Addition
- `sub(a, b)` - Subtraction  
- `mult(a, b)` - Multiplication
- `div(a, b)` - Division

**User Query**: `2-10*5`

Without Tool Interrupt:
```
Input: 2-10*5
Output: The answer is -48
```

With Tool Interrupt:

**Step 1:** System identifies first operation
```
Tool to call: mult(a, b)
Parameters: a=10, b=5
```

**User Options:**

- **Edit**: Modify parameters (e.g., change to a=5, b=2)

Click on the Edit option as shown below to modify the parameters:

The image below shows where you can edit the parameters:

- **üëç**: Approve current parameters.

**Step 2:** If user approves original parameters
```
Tool executed: mult(10, 5) = 50
Next tool: sub(a, b)
Parameters: a=2, b=50
```

**Step 3:** User approves subtraction
```
Tool executed: sub(2, 50) = -48
Final Answer: -48
```

**Alternative Step 2:** If user edits multiplication parameters
```
Modified parameters: mult(5, 2) = 10
Next tool: sub(a, b)
Parameters: a=2, b=10
```

**Final Result with edited parameters:**
```
Tool executed: sub(2, 10) = -8
Final Answer: -8
```

## Benefits of Tool Interrupt

**Enhanced Control**

- Users can intervene in the tool execution process
- Ability to correct parameters before execution
- Prevention of unintended tool calls

**Transparency**

- Clear visibility into which tools are being called
- Understanding of parameter values being used
- Step-by-step execution visibility

**Debugging and Testing**
- Ability to test different parameter combinations
- Easy identification of tool execution issues
- Validation of tool selection logic

**Educational Value**
- Understanding of how complex queries are broken down
- Learning about tool dependencies and execution order
- Insight into agent decision-making process

## Best Practices

**Enable Tool Interrupt when:**
- Testing new agent configurations
- Working with sensitive data or operations
- Learning how tools interact with each other
- Debugging complex queries
- Need precise control over tool parameters

**Disable Tool Interrupt when:**
- Running routine, well-tested operations
- Processing bulk queries
- Working with trusted tool configurations
- Need fast, automated responses

**Parameter Editing Guidelines :**

- **Review Carefully**: Always review the suggested parameters before editing
- **Understand Dependencies**: Consider how parameter changes might affect subsequent tools
- **Test Incrementally**: Make small changes and observe results
- **Document Changes**: Keep track of parameter modifications for future reference
