Agentic Foundry supports three types of agent templates: 

- **React Agent**: Designed for single-task operations, React Agents use a step-by-step reasoning process to determine and execute the appropriate actions. They are ideal for scenarios requiring precise and efficient task execution. Learn more in the [React Agent Design](React Agent Design.md) document.

- **Multi Agent**: Multi Agents enable collaboration between specialized agents to achieve complex objectives. They follow the **Planner-Executor-Critic** paradigm, ensuring tasks are planned, executed, and evaluated effectively. Detailed information is available in the [Multi Agent Design](Multi Agent Design.md) document.

- **Meta Agent**: Acting as orchestrators, Meta Agents manage and coordinate other agents to achieve high-level goals. They dynamically adapt to context and task requirements, ensuring seamless execution. Explore their design in the [Meta Agent Design](Orchestration Meta Agent Design.md) document.

Each agent template is highly customizable, allowing developers to tailor them to specific use cases, making Agentic Foundry a robust platform for building intelligent systems.
