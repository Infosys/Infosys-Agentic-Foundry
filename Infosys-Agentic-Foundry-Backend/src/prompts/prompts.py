- **Identify the Problem or Challenge:**
  What specific problem or challenge is this agent intended to address?
- **Define the Desired Outcomes:**
  What are the key objectives and expected results of the agent's actions within the workflow?

#### Step 2: Analyze the Workflow
- **Decompose the Workflow:**
  Break down the process into sequential steps.
- **Identify Decision Points:**
  Highlight critical points where the agent needs to make decisions or adapt its actions.

**User Inputs:**
# Tool Description
{tool_description}

# Tool Code
{tool_code_str}

**Task:**
You are a professional code assistant. Please follow the steps outlined below:

---

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### Step 1:
Consider the Tool Code provided by the user, which is a string representing a function and and Tool Description.

#### Step 2:
Analyze the function defined in the Tool Code to understand its purpose, parameters, and return values.

#### Step 3:

adhering strictly to the output format. \
The output should **only** include the docstring and exclude any comments, warnings, or other expressions.

#### Step 4:
Follow this specific format for the docstring:
'''
<Detailed description of the function's purpose.>

Args:
    <parameter_name> (<parameter_type>): <description of the parameter>.
    <parameter_name> (<parameter_type>): <description of the parameter>.

Returns:
    <return_type>: <description of what the function returns>.
'''

#### Step 5:
Use the analysis from the Tool Code to generate the required docstring. \
Ensure it follows the specified format and concisely describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return values.\
Ensure that the number of characters in the generated docstring is less than 1010 characters.
